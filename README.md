Educating Internet Safety to Children through Video Games

Project Abstract

The Internet has changed humanity in countless ways. The ability to send and receive information instantly has virtually nullified the boundaries of communication which existed just a few decades ago. However, with the rise of technology comes the ability to exploit and misuse it. The Internet now carries misinformation and scam attempts such as fake news and phishing. 

In addition to that, it harbours a multitude if illegal activities and cyber crimes such as the spread of violent propaganda, drug dealership and child pornography. Although the respected authorities have been able to attack many of these issues, the sheer amount websites hosted on the Internet coupled with the numerous ways that website trails can be hidden makes it impossible to crack down every instance of illegal activity on the world wide web. This leaves users of the Internet still very vulnerable to cyber attacks and illegal trades. Prevention of these issues alone will not be able to protect the users, thus education of Internet safety must be paired along with it.

With the sudden rise of technology and its accessibility and ease to use increasing, children from the age of five are now able to navigate the internet with little effort. Children are viewing videos and playing video games mostly without any online restrictions. A child could accidently stumble across a pornographic video or be playing a violent video game suitable only for adults. Current websites which promote website safety still host Internet safety games and quizzes from decades ago.  The games are out of date and no longer captivate the attention of children. 

It is concerning that the importance of Internet safety has not grown in tandem with Internet accessibility, especially when even more and more children are able to use the Internet. With this in mind, this study hopes to research cyber crimes and Internet misuse as well as produce an enjoyable and interesting method of conveying Internet safety through video games.
